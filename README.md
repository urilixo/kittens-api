# README

This project was made for a [lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)


* Task

The task was to create a simple API using Rails.

* Thoughts

While this wasn't my first time using an API, it was my first time creating one, it was a good learning experience to better understand what happens on the serving side of it!
